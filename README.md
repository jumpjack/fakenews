Everything started on **July 2025**, when it was announced the upcoming announcement of imminent **worldwide** eclipse on august 12th.

Given that no eclipse can be worldwide, this news was quite suspicious. But it got replicated, retwitted and reposted everywhere.... until August 12th, when nothing happened... because the eclipse is [schduled for August 12th... but 2026](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclissi_solare_del_12_agosto_2026)!

This is probably an "allucination" by some of those AI bots which already replaced humans in writing articles in blog.

Stay tuned, because this is just the beginning!

I was not able to find again the fake news of the eclipse, probably now removed, but I saved the new one about NASA capturing an asteroid.
